# Why I did this
I have been burned with Wordpress before. Hard to keep secure, loads and loads of packages and dependencies to keep up to date, template system pretty flaky.

## Step 1
Go to NetlifyCMS and pick a starter package. I chose Hugo.

## Step 2
- Follow the instructions
- Check your email to click the links in various emails to:
  - Start the build and deployment to your GitHib account
  - Set a password for your new Netlify account (so you can edit your website)

## Step 3
Log into the CMS with your Netlify password and start updating your website.
